## What is Sortify?

Sortify is a `Serverless Cloud based Image Management System` that provides
a clustering based sorting of images based on file and user provided meta-data.
The main features of this app are as follows:

1. **Cloud Based**: Media storage in AWS S3
2. **Serverless**: Clustering algorithms hosted on AWS Lambda

## Why Sortify?

Have you ever faced an issue of manually sorting the images after a trip into your albums
or accessing any old photos 📸 that you want to show it to a friend but you forgot where you
had it stored. We got you covered!
* Sortify provides you an interface where you can securely upload your media files from a trip
to a cloud server, allowing you to access your data anytime anywhere (thanks to AWS Cloud services)!
* None of your data can be accessed by anyone except you. However, the service makes use of
metadata to help you manage your images!
