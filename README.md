## What is Sortify?

Sortify is a `Serverless Cloud based Image Management System` that provides

2. **Serverless**: Clustering algorithms hosted on AWS Lambda

## Why Sortify?

or accessing any old photos üì∏ that you want to show it to a friend but you forgot where you
had it stored. We got you covered!
* Sortify provides you an interface where you can securely upload your media files from a trip
to a cloud server, allowing you to access your data anytime anywhere (thanks to AWS Cloud services)!
